imgscalr - Java Image-Scaling Library
http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/imgscalr-java-image-scaling-library/


Changelog
---------
2.1
	* Scaling of certain image types (and byte layouts) could result in very poor
	looking scaled images ("pixelated" look, discolored dithering, etc.). This was
	corrected by imgscalr forcibly scaling all source images into the most well-supported
	image types by Java2D, resulting in excellent scale result quality regardless
	of the Method specified.
	* The issue of scaling of poorly supported (by Java2D) image-types can lead 
	to unexpectedly poor performance was also corrected as a side-effect of this
	because all source images are converted to the most commonly supported image
	type for Java2D.

2.0
	* API-break: resize(BufferedImage, Method, int, int, boolean, boolean) was removed and
	replaced by resize(BufferedImage, Method, int, int).
	* DEBUG system variable added; set 'imgscalr.debug' to true to trigger debugging output
	in the console. The boolean debug and elapsedTime arguments to the resize method
	have been removed.
	* New BALANCED method added. Provides a better result than SPEED faster than QUALITY.
	* Added 2 optimized thresholds (in pixels) that the API uses to select the best Method
	for scaling when the user specifies AUTOMATIC (or doesn't specify a method). This helps
	provide much better results out of the box by default and tightens up the performance of the
	API a bit more.
	* Image comparison generator utility (ComparisonGenerator test class) added.
	* Functional portions of API broken into static protected methods that can be
	easily overridden by implementors to customize the API without needing to rewrite
	the resize methods.
	* Consolidated 5 locations of duplicated rendering code into a single method (scaleImage).
	* Tightened up image scaling operation to do everything possible to avoid memory leaks (every native
	resource is disposed or released explicitly)
	* Detailed logging information integrated. If the 'imgscalr.debug' system property is
	true, the API outputs exactly what it's doing, what argument values it is processing and
	how long it is taking to do each scale operation.
	* When AUTOMATIC method is specified, the API is more intelligent about selecting
	SPEED, BALANCED or QUALITY based on the images primary dimension only (more accurate).
	* Copious amounts of Javadoc added to new methods, new code and existing code.

1.2
	* Default proportional-scaling logic is more straight forward. If an image is
	landscape then width is the preferred dimension and the given height is ignored
	(and recalculated) and visa-versa if the image is portrait oriented. This gives
	much better "default behavior" results.
	* Added new convenience method resize(BufferedImage,int,int)
	* Modified build.xml to output Maven-friendly artifact names.
	* Library now available from the http://maven.thebuzzmedia.com Maven repo, see
	"Maven" section on this page for more information:

Description
-----------
A class implementing performant, good-looking and intelligent image-scaling algorithms
in pure Java. This class implements the Java2D "best practices" when it comes to
scaling images as well as Chris Campbell's incremental scaling algorithm proposed
as the best method for down-sizes images for use as thumbnails (along with some
additional minor optimizations).

TIP: All resizing operations maintain the original images proportions.

This class attempts to make scaling images in Java as simple as possible by providing
a handful of approaches tuned for scaling as fast as possible or as best-looking 
as possible and the ability to let the algorithm choose for you to optionally create 
the best-looking scaled image as fast as possible without boring you with the details 
if you don't want them.


Example
-------
In the simplest use-case where an image needs to be scaled to proportionally fit 
a specific width (say 150px for a thumbnail) and the class is left to decide which 
method will look the best, the code would look like this:

  BufferedImage srcImage = ImageIO.read(...); // Load image
  BufferedImage scaledImage = Scalr.resize(srcImage, 150); // Scale image

You could even flatten that out further if you simply wanted to scale the image 
and write out the scaled result immediately to a single line:

  ImageIO.write(Scalr.resize(ImageIO.read(...), 150));


Troubleshooting
---------------
Image-manipulation in Java can take more memory than the size of the source image
because the image has to be "decoded" into raw ARGB bytes when loaded into the
BufferedImage instance; fortunately on most platforms this is a hardware-accelerated
operation by the video card.

If you are running into OutOfMemoryExceptions when using this library (e.g. if you
dealing with 10+ MB source images from an ultra-high-MP DSLR) try and up the 
heap size using the "-Xmx" command line argument to your Java process.

An example of how to do this looks like:

  java -Xmx128m com.site.MyApp
